Github, by design, restricts the number of times you can fork a repo into a single account. Even then, after forking, you are bound to the upstream in your repo page, which if you are doing an iterative work can sometimes be a hinderance to marketing. There are [hacks](https://adrianshort.org/create-multiple-forks-of-a-github-repo/)  [and](http://therebelrobot.com/tech/2015/10/16/a-simple-method-to-fork-repos-more-than-once.html) [workarounds](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/)Â for this, but **mirror** provides a user-friendly UI to apply them without command line knowledge.

### 1:1 copies

Ever wanted to start a new project based off an old one? You can do that using **mirror**. Just put in the source and target repos, and we'll do the rest for you. Easy peasy.

### infinite forks

Ever wanted more than one fork of a repo? Boilerplates? Iterative works? **mirror** lets you fork to your heart's content.

### break from upstream

Making a brand new iterative work? What do you do if you want to fork and break from the upstream entirely? With normal forking, your repo will always link back to the upstream version next to the title, but **mirror** gives you the power to break free and start fresh.
